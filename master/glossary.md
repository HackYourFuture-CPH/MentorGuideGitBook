# ðŸ“• Glossary

{% hint style="info" %}
We have recently updated the language we use to shift away from school-like language to better represent our program's philosophy.

You may still find traces of the outdated terms. How you can help the transition:

1. Please update outdated terms if you spot them anywhere, or raise them to a staff member.
2. If you hear people use any outdated terms, feel free to kindly nudge them towards the new terms (or point them to this page for clarification).
