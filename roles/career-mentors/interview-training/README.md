# Interview Training

Our goal with this type of training is to prepare our trainees for two types of interviews:

1. "[HR Interviews](mock-hr-interview.md)" - usually similar to a first round interview, where the focus is rather on presentability, team-fit and communication skills.
2. "[Technial Interviews](mock-technical-interview.md)" - preparing trainees for interview situations that contain live coding or talking about code assignments.
