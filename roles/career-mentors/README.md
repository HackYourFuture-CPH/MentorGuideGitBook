# ðŸ“ˆ Career Mentors

The mission of HYF is simple: _Help our trainees get into quality tech jobs_. \
\
As a Career Mentor you will support the trainees on the "final mile" of their journey to become a tech professional and support them with knowledge about how to land their first job in tech.\
\
These roles are for volunteers with and without a technical background, but **in-depth knowledge of the Danish IT Industry and its hiring processes is a key requirement**.

We split up these volunteering roles in 3 main categories:

* [Jobseeker Toolkit](jobseeker-toolkit.md) (CV, Linkedin, GitHub)
* [Interview Training](interview-training/) (HR & Technical interview scenarios)
* [1:1 Career Coaching](1-1-career-coach.md) (individual mentoring)
