# 💻 Technical Mentors

As a technical mentor you become a part of the trainees' learning journey, but also their **professional network**. It's up to you, if you want to connect with all trainees on e.g. Linkedin, but it would be a big advantage for them as they often have no existing professional network in the IT-industry yet. We encourage you to build meaningful connections with the trainees.

Most new Technical Mentors at HackYourFuture will start their volunteering journey as an **Assignment Reviewer**. You then gradually move through the different volunteering roles which will give you the confidence and expertise to become a **Session Lead.**
