# ðŸ’» Technical Mentors

As a technical mentor you become a part of the student's learning journey, but also their **professional network**. It's up to you, if you want to connect with all students on e.g. Linkedin, but it would be a big advantage for them as they often have no existing professional network in the IT-industry yet. We encourage you to build meaningful connections with the learners.\
\
Most new Technical Mentors at HackYourFuture will start their Volunteering Journey as a **Homework Reviewer**. You then gradually move through the different volunteering roles which will give you the confidence and expertise to be a **Lead Teacher**.
