# 📍 Location: Copenhagen

We host our onsite workshops on **Sundays** from **12:00 - 16:00** at a co-working space on Holmen called [Talent Garden](https://talentgarden.org/en/coworking/denmark/copenhagen/). If you are volunteering, please arrive by 11:45 so there's time to grab a coffee and get set up. \
\
The address is **Danneskjold Samsø's Allé 41**. We don't always put out signs outside or inside the building, so you can find us as described on the images below:\

Please always give our staff a heads-up if you plan to swing by for a spontaneous visit via <cph@hackyourfuture.dk>. That way we can put some time aside for showing you around.\
\
Hope to see you soon!\
